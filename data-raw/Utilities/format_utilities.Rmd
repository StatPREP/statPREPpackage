These data are transcribed from the monthly utility statements over 18 years (and counting!) for a home in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA. 

```{r}
months <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
tmp <- read_csv("data-raw/Utilities/utilities-up-to-date.csv")
tmp$month <- factor(months[tmp$month], levels = months)
```

```{r}
MN_home <- tmp
save(MN_home, file = "../../data/MN_home.rda")
```

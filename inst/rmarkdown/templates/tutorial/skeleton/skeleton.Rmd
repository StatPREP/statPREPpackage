## Topics

2nd level headers (`##`) introduce the titles of the topics.  Be sure to leave a space after `##`.

You can type any text you like.  If you want to emaphsize something, you can use **bold** or *italics*.

To find out about all the markup options, see the 
[R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
that RStudio provides or the Markdown.Quick Reference in the Help menu.

## Exercises

### A Basic Exercise

To create an exercise, add `exercise = TRUE` to the chunk header.  Make sure the chunk
has a label. (Here we use `example-exercise` for the label.)

```{r, example-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(height ~ mother, data = Galton)
```

### An Auto-Evaluated Exercise

This code will be run without the user having to click on "Run Code".
Note the each exercise must have a unique label.

```{r, autoeval-exercise, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
gf_point(height ~ mother, data = Galton)
```

### Exercise Hints

Replace `goal` with one of the plotting functions.

```{r, exercise3, exercise = TRUE}
goal(height ~ mother, data = Galton)
```

<div id="exercise3-hint">
Here are some possible choices: `gf_point()`, `gf_line()`, `gf_smooth()`, `gf_spline()`,
`gf_lm()`.  Remeber, you can overlay more than one layer if you use `%>%` between layers.
</div>
